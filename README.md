# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Using LIME 🧬

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Prediction Using LIME** project!  
This repository demonstrates how to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning, and explains model predictions with the help of the [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) library.

## 📊 Project Overview

Predicting who survived the Titanic disaster is a classic machine learning challenge. In this project, we:

- ⚙️ Build a predictive model to estimate the probability of passenger survival.
- 🔍 Use LIME to interpret and visualize the model's decision-making process.
- 💡 Make machine learning predictions more transparent and accessible.

## 🗂️ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data.
- **Model Training**: Trains a robust classifier (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
- **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Interpretability with LIME**: Explains individual predictions visually and textually.
- **Easy-to-Understand Visualizations**: Plots and charts to make results intuitive.
